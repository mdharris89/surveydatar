\title{Bind rows while preserving metadata}
\usage{
bind_rows(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data frames to combine. Each argument can either be a data frame,
a list that could be a data frame, or a list of data frames. Columns are
matched by name, and any missing columns will be filled with \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A data frame, as from dplyr::bind_rows, with metadata reconciled and reapplied
}
\description{
Wrapper around dplyr::bind_rows that preserves column metadata across inputs,
preferring metadata from the first dataset on conflicts and emitting a single
aggregated warning. Preserved metadata includes variable labels
(attr(, "label")) and value labels (attr(, "labels")). Other simple
attributes (excluding structural ones like names/class/dim) are also
preserved based on the first dataset in which the column appears.
}
\details{
This function masks dplyr::bind_rows and is intended to be a drop-in
replacement. It accepts the same signature and passes all arguments through
to dplyr.
