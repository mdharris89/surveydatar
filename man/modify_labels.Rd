\title{Modify row and column labels using pattern matching}
\usage{
modify_labels(tab_result, row_labels = NULL, col_labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab_result}{A tab_result object (cell-based)}

\item{row_labels}{Named character vector of pattern/replacement pairs for row labels.
Patterns are applied sequentially to labels in layout$row_defs.}

\item{col_labels}{Named character vector of pattern/replacement pairs for column labels.
Patterns are applied sequentially to labels in layout$col_defs.}
}
\value{
Modified tab_result with updated labels in layout structure
}
\description{
Apply gsub pattern replacements to row and column labels in the layout structure.
Labels are pure metadata and modifications persist through all layout operations.
Patterns are applied sequentially in the order provided.
}
